# Fibonacci-Sequence
Have you heard about [Fibonacci Numbers/Sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number)? I built a python program to literally get any Fibonacci sequence number! :)

# FAQs

❄ **What is way 1?**
- Let's say that you want the 5th fibonacci number instantly or the 15th one. In this case, you should use way 1.

❄ **What is way 2?**
- Let's say you want to test how good my program works or perhaps you want to go through all fibonacci numbers from the starting (0), till you get tired of it. In this case, you should use way 2.

❄ **How to use-**
- **To follow the way 1**: type "1" in the terminal after running the file.
- **To follow the way 2**: type "2" in the terminal after running the file.

If you're using *way 1*, you'd have to enter which fibonacci number you want based on it's position. Answer will be provided immediately after this!
And if you're uing *way 2*, you'd have to keep your eyes on the program for a while. Much elaborately: You'll continously be given the "next fib-number" and asked for whether you wish to end the program after each fib-number you're provided.

Enter "y" for yes, that is, you do want to *end* the program or "n" for no, that is, you wish to continu the program (recommended!).
Have fun!
